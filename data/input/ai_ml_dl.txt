
    ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OVERVIEW

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

    Key applications of AI include:
    - Expert systems
    - Natural language processing (NLP)
    - Speech recognition
    - Machine vision

    AI can be categorized as either weak or strong. Weak AI is designed to perform a narrow task, while strong AI can perform any intellectual task that a human can.

    MACHINE LEARNING FUNDAMENTALS

    Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, ML models learn patterns from data.

    There are three main types of machine learning:
    1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
    2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
    3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

    DEEP LEARNING ADVANCEMENTS

    Deep Learning uses neural networks with many layers to learn from large amounts of data. These deep neural networks have revolutionized fields like computer vision and natural language processing.

    Popular deep learning architectures include:
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for images
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequences
    - Transformers for natural language processing

    The transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, has become the foundation for modern large language models like GPT and BERT.
