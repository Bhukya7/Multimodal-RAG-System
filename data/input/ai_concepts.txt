
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines 
    that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be 
    applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as 
    learning and problem-solving.
    
    Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of computer programs 
    that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins 
    with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order 
    to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future.
    
    Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers. 
    These deep neural networks have revolutionized fields like computer vision, natural 
    language processing, and speech recognition.
